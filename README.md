# CSS Challenge â€“ Visual Rebuild Under Constraints

This project was completed as part of a time-boxed internal CSS coding challenge. Developers were given a static PNG and 8 hours to rebuild the layout using only HTML and CSSâ€”without external assets, SVGs, or any use of AI tools. The goal was to match the original design as closely as possible in terms of contour accuracy, color fidelity, shadow detail, and stylistic execution, while also being scored for code elegance and minimalism.

I used semantic HTML and SCSS to structure and manage my project, leveraging mixins, variables, and nested selectors for modularity and clarity. The layout was built at a fixed resolution using custom grid and flexbox structures, with pixel-level precision applied to alignments, layering, spacing, and typography.

In addition to the visual rebuild, part of the scoring depended on total character count across both HTML and CSS. I optimized my codebase to reduce redundancy while maintaining clarity, targeting bonus points for falling below the mean character count. 

## No build tools, SVGs, or frameworks were allowed. This was all raw CSS styling.
